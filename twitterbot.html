             BLM-resources was built since we were seeing a wealth of information and tips on social media in regards to the . While those are great and amazing there were a couple problems at hand:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>There was a lot of disinformation and misinformation flying around. We're hoping this site would act as a source of truth.</li>
            <li>Tweets are hard to categorize/search/filter. Unless you had a system in place, it was hard to find information again.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>As a result, we decided to build this application as a centralized place in which people can find and contribute information.</p>
