             BLM-resources was built since we were seeing a wealth of information and tips on social media in regards to the . While those are great and amazing there were a couple problems at hand:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>It's hard to categorize, search, or filter those brilliant bits of information. Unless you have some sort of system already in place, it's fairly easy to lose track of information.</li>
            <li>There's <i>a lot</i> of disinformation and misinformation going on. That's not always the easiest to figure out right away so we're hoping links and resources here become somewhat of a source of information.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>As a result, we decided to build this application as a centralized place in which people can find and contribute information.</p>
