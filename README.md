# [BLM-resources](https://www.blm-resources.com)

`BLM-resources` was built since we were seeing a wealth of information and tips on Twitter in regards to the Black Lives Matter protests. While those are great and amazing, there's a couple problems at hand:

1. It's hard to categorize, search, or filter those brilliant bits of information. Unless you have some sort of system already in place, it's fairly easy to lose track of information.
2. There's _a lot_ of disinformation and misinformation going on. That's not always the easiest to figure out right away so we're hoping links and resources here become somewhat of a source of information.

### Dev notes

This user interface is built with vanilla html/css/js since we're looking to optimize performance. We imagined that the audience would mostly view this on mobile devices with varying amount of processing & data.
